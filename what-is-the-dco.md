# What is the DCO?

When contributing, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: J. Doe <j.doe@theirdomain.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change
to your local git repository using

```bash
$ git commit -s
```

By signing your work, you are confirming that the origin of the content
makes it suitable to add to this project.  See
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).
